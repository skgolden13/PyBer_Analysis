# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview

PyBer has requested a new analysis with a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Additionally, a multiple-line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type has been requested for comparison and decision making at PyBer.

All raw data files can be found [here](https://github.com/skgolden13/PyBer_Analysis/tree/main/Resources).</br>
All charts and images can be found [here](https://github.com/skgolden13/PyBer_Analysis/tree/main/analysis).</br>
The jupyter notebook file for the original analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/skgolden13/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer.ipynb).</br>
The jupyter notebook file for this analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/skgolden13/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer_Challenge.ipynb).</br>

## Analysis Results

The summary data frame (shown in Figure 1) shows multiple differences between urban, suburban, and rural cities:
- Urban cities have the most total rides
- Rural cities have the least total rides
- Urban cities have the most total drivers
- Rural cities have the least total drivers
- Urban cities produce the most total fares
- Rural cities produce the least total fares
- Urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride and per city
- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and per city

The fare summary line plot by week and city type (shown in Figure 2) shows that the difference in total fares in each city type is consistent from January to April 2019. Each city type trends similarly on a week by week basis and the overall difference from Figure 1 is not being driven by any outliers.
